# Trimmed Mean Package

This package provides a Go function to calculate the trimmed mean of a slice of floating-point numbers. The trimmed mean is a robust statistic for central tendency, which removes a specified proportion of the smallest and largest values before computing the mean of the remaining data.


## Installation

To install the package, run:

```sh
go get github.com/TheFoxForever/assignment_week_9/trimmedmean
